Chapter 3 - "Transfer 3"
As Professor Martinez dismissed the class, I shoved my laptop into my bag with shaking hands. When I looked up, Sunny was still there, waiting for me with that easy smile that made my stomach flip. Right. Lunch. We were having lunch together. This was actually happening.

The walk across campus felt like some kind of surreal dream. Here I was, walking next to the most beautiful person I'd ever seen, and I couldn't manage to string together a single coherent sentence.

"Thanks for being so kind to me today," Sunny said as we navigated between groups of students. "I know I'm the new guy and all, but I really struggle with making friends sometimes. It means a lot that you're willing to open up to me."

I nodded, my mind reeling. How could someone like him possibly have trouble making friends? He was perfect. Confident. Smart. The kind of person everyone would want to be around.

"The campus is really different from Seoul University," he continued, seemingly unbothered by my silence. "Everything's so spread out here. Back home, you could practically live in the library and never—"

Suddenly, his hand was on my arm, pulling me sideways. My entire body went rigid as he pressed me against his side for just a moment. I could feel the solid warmth of his chest, the definition of muscle beneath his shirt. He was incredibly fit, and he smelled like heaven and—

"Careful there," he said with a laugh, releasing me and pointing ahead. "That tree would have definitely won that fight."

I looked up to see a low-hanging branch exactly where I'd been about to walk. My face burned with mortification. Of course. Of course I'd been so busy staring at the ground and overthinking everything that I'd nearly walked face-first into a tree.

"You really do keep your head down a lot," he added teasingly. "It's going to get you in trouble one of these days."

I wanted to disappear into the pavement. Could this get any more embarrassing?

"Clara!"

Sophie's voice cut through my spiral of shame like a lifeline. She appeared from behind a group of students, her face lighting up when she saw me. Her expression shifted to barely contained curiosity when she noticed Sunny.

She wrapped me in a quick hug, and I felt some of the tension leave my shoulders. Sophie had this way of making everything feel more manageable just by existing.

"Well, well," she said, stepping back but keeping one hand on my arm. She leaned in close, her voice dropping to what she probably thought was a whisper. "How exactly did you manage to bag someone that gorgeous?"

I elbowed her gently, shooting her a pleading look. Please don't say anything weird, I tried to communicate telepathically.

Sunny laughed, apparently having heard every word. "I'm Sunny," he said, extending his hand to Sophie. "And you must be the famous roommate Clara's told me so much about."

I definitely had not told him anything about Sophie, but she didn't need to know that.

"Sophie," she replied, shaking his hand with a grin. "And Clara's told me absolutely nothing about you, which is actually very telling."

"Sophie," I managed to croak out, but she was already in full interrogation mode.

"Sunny's an interesting name," she continued. "Family nickname?"

"Something like that," he said easily. "My real name is Song Il-Seong, but most Americans have trouble with it. Sunny just makes things simpler."

"Korean?"

"Born and raised in Seoul. Just transferred here because my father's work brought us to the States."

Sophie nodded approvingly, like he'd passed some kind of test. "And how did you two meet? Clara's not exactly known for her... social initiative."

I felt my cheeks burn again, but Sunny just smiled. "We have calculus together. And she's actually really sweet once you get past the whole shy thing. It's pretty cute, honestly."

I practically dove behind Sophie at that comment, using her as a human shield. Sunny's laughter followed me.

"I'm kidding," he said, but I could hear the warmth in his voice. "Sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you."

Sophie's expression softened slightly, and when she spoke again, her tone was more serious. "Clara deals with some social anxiety," she said gently. "It's not personal if she's quiet. She just... it takes her a while to warm up to people."

"I noticed," Sunny said, and there was no judgment in his voice. "But that's okay. Some of the best people are the quiet ones."

Sophie squeezed my hand. "As her self-appointed spokesperson and longtime friend, I just want her to have more people in her corner, you know? She deserves good friends."

I nodded mutely, touched by Sophie's protectiveness but also mortified that she was essentially giving Sunny my entire psychological profile.

"Well, you don't have to worry about me," Sunny said. "I'm just happy she's willing to put up with me."

We'd reached the dining hall, and Sunny paused at the entrance. "Actually, let me get lunch for everyone today. My treat."

I started to shake my head—I couldn't let him pay for my food, that was too much—but he was already pulling out his wallet.

"I insist," he said. "New guy privilege."

I nodded reluctantly, my mind spinning. Was this what guys did when they were interested in someone? Or was he just being polite? Maybe he felt sorry for me after witnessing my complete inability to function like a normal human being.

But maybe—just maybe—there was something more to it.

Maybe he actually liked me.
