Chapter 9 - "The Coffee Spot"
As we walked out of the dorm building toward the campus coffee shop, Sophie was in the middle of explaining how her psychology professor had completely butchered a lesson on cognitive behavioral therapy when I spotted her.

Amelia Adams, sitting alone at one of the outdoor tables near the campus coffee shop, looking like she'd stepped out of a magazine even at 8 AM. Her blonde hair caught the morning light perfectly, and she was wearing one of those effortlessly expensive outfits that probably cost more than my monthly food budget.

"What's she doing here?" Sophie asked, following my gaze. "And why is she alone? Queen Bee never travels without her entourage."

That's when I saw him. Sunny, walking up to her table with two coffee cups in his hands, that same easy smile I'd seen yesterday before I'd completely lost my mind at him.

Something cold and angry twisted in my stomach. What the hell was he doing with her?

"Oh, this is interesting," Sophie said, grabbing my wrist. "Come on, let's listen in."

"Sophie, no, I don't want to—"

But she was already pulling me toward a bench around the corner from their table, positioned just right so we could hear everything without being seen. At least, I hoped we couldn't be seen.

I watched as Sunny pulled out Amelia's chair for her, the picture of perfect manners.

"What a gentleman," Amelia said, her voice carrying that sweet tone she used when she wanted something. "Thank you."

Sunny settled into his own chair, sliding one of the coffees across to her. "I don't think I caught your name yesterday."

"Amelia," she said, and I could practically hear her smile. "I'm captain of the cheerleading team, studying business with a focus on marketing. What about you?"

"I'm Sunny—transferred here from Seoul University. Computer engineering, but I focus more on the hardware side of things."

I frowned. That wasn't what he'd told me. Yesterday, he'd specifically said he was doing computer science with a focus on AI development. Either he'd lied to Amelia, lied to me, or he just lied to everyone depending on what he thought they wanted to hear.

"That's really cool," Amelia said, though her tone suggested she found it anything but cool. "Must be challenging, coming from such a different educational system."

"It has its moments," Sunny replied smoothly. "Though I have to say, American universities have a much more... social atmosphere than I'm used to."

From my angle, I could only see Amelia's profile, but even from here I could tell she was laying on the charm thick. She leaned forward slightly, her posture screaming flirtation.

"I bet it gets lonely, being so far from home," she said. "Do you have anyone here to show you around? Any... special friends?"

There was definitely suggestion in her voice, but Sunny's response was perfectly neutral.

"I've never really dated anyone, actually," he said. "Too focused on studies, I guess. What about you? I imagine someone like you has plenty of options."

Smooth. He'd deflected her obvious hint and turned the question back on her without seeming rude or uninterested.

"Oh, you know how it is," Amelia said with a laugh that sounded practiced. "I'm pretty selective. I prefer guys who can keep up intellectually."

"Smart," Sunny said. "Intelligence is definitely attractive."

Another perfect non-answer that could mean anything or nothing.

"So what do you do for fun?" Amelia continued. "Besides studying, obviously."

"I've been getting into gaming lately," Sunny said. "Found someone to show me the ropes."

My heart did something complicated. Was he talking about me?

"Gaming?" Amelia's voice had a slight edge now. "Like video games?"

"World of Dungeons, specifically. It's actually more strategic than I expected."

"Hmm." Amelia's tone suggested she found this about as appealing as discussing tax law. "I'm more of an outdoor activities person myself. Hiking, tennis, that sort of thing."

"That's great. Staying active is important."

Again, perfectly polite but completely noncommittal.

The conversation continued like this for several more minutes—Amelia trying various angles to establish some kind of connection or shared interest, and Sunny responding with just enough engagement to seem interested while giving her absolutely nothing to work with. It was like watching a master class in social deflection.

"You know," Amelia said, her voice dropping to what I assumed was supposed to be a sultry tone, "I could show you some great spots around town. There's this amazing restaurant downtown that has the best Korean fusion food..."

"That's very kind of you," Sunny said. "Though I have to admit, I'm still getting used to the workload here. Not much time for exploration right now."

Polite rejection without actually saying no. Impressive.

"Of course," Amelia said, but I could hear the frustration creeping into her voice. "Well, maybe once you're more settled in."

"Maybe," Sunny agreed, in a tone that clearly meant 'probably not.'

"I should probably get going," Amelia said after another moment. "Early class."

"Of course. Thanks for the company."

I heard the scrape of chairs against concrete as they stood up. From my hiding spot, I watched Amelia walk away, her perfect posture just slightly more rigid than before.

Then Sunny turned around, and I caught sight of his face for the first time since they'd sat down.

The friendly warmth from our conversations was completely gone. His expression was cold, almost irritated, like he'd just endured something unpleasant but necessary. It was such a stark contrast from the polite charm he'd been radiating just seconds before that it was almost unsettling.

And then his eyes met mine.

My heart stopped. He'd seen me. Seen us hiding behind this bench like a couple of stalkers.

"Run," I hissed to Sophie, grabbing her arm and pulling her away from the bench.

"What? Why?" she protested as I dragged her toward the main walkway.

"He saw us," I said, breathing hard. My face was burning with embarrassment. "God, he probably thinks we're insane."

"Oh come on, it was just getting interesting," Sophie laughed. "Did you see how he completely shut her down? That was art."

"Promise me we're never doing that again," I said, checking over my shoulder to make sure Sunny wasn't following us. "I don't like... spying on people."

"Fine, fine," Sophie said, still grinning. "Though you have to admit, that was enlightening."

She glanced down at her watch and her expression shifted. "Oh shit, Clara, you've got like five minutes until calculus starts."

I looked at my own phone and felt my stomach drop. She was right.

"Okay, I've got to run," I said, already backing away from her. "Wish me luck."

"Good luck!" she called after me as I broke into a sprint across campus, my backpack bouncing against my spine with every step.

Just what I needed—to show up to class breathless and flustered after being caught spying on him.
