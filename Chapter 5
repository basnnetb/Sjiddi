Chapter 5 - "Amelia Adams"
"You should just ask him out," Sophie said the moment Sunny disappeared around the corner.

I sighed, slumping back in my chair. "I don't have a chance with someone like him."

Sophie laughed, shaking her head. "Oh, so now you decide to speak? After sitting there like a mute statue for the past hour?"

I punched her arm lightly. "It's hard to talk, okay?"

She responded by just nodding at me, mimicking my usual response to everything, and I groaned.

"He's just... perfect," I said, letting my head fall forward onto the table. "In every possible way."

"You want me to ask him out for you? I could totally make it casual."

"No way." I lifted my head to stare at her in horror. "Absolutely not. Someone like him could never be with someone like me."

"You never know," Sophie said with a shrug, but her phone buzzed before she could elaborate. She glanced at the screen and her expression shifted. "Marcus needs me for something. You gonna be okay walking to Algebraic Topology by yourself?"

I sighed. "Maybe."

She gathered her plates—somehow she'd managed to clean every single one—and gave my shoulder a quick squeeze. "Don't overthink everything, okay?"

As she walked away, I started clearing our table, my mind already spinning. Two classes together. At least my mornings would be more interesting now that I had something to look forward to. Maybe I should try to look better tomorrow. Actually put in some effort.

I dismissed the thought immediately. What would be the point? It wouldn't change who I was underneath.

I headed to the bathroom to wash up before my next class. The fluorescent lights made everything look harsh and unflattering, which seemed appropriate given my mood. I was splashing water on my face when I caught sight of movement in the mirror.

My stomach dropped.

Amelia Adams stood near the sinks with her usual entourage, and she was just as stunning as always. Long blonde hair that somehow managed to look effortlessly perfect, the kind of bone structure that belonged in magazines, and clothes that probably cost more than I made in three months at my part-time job. She was everything I wasn't—confident, beautiful, connected. Her father was Thomas Adams, basically the unofficial king of Brighton College's board of directors.

I'd been dealing with Amelia's particular brand of cruelty since middle school, and nothing about her had improved with age.

I tried to make myself smaller, focusing on the soap dispenser and hoping she wouldn't notice me. But my luck had been terrible all day, so of course it continued.

"Look what we have here," I heard her say to her friends, though she wasn't addressing me directly. "The bathroom troll finally emerges from her cave."

Her friends giggled in that practiced way that meant they thought they were supposed to find it funny. I'd learned to read these social dynamics over the years, even if I couldn't participate in them. The girls surrounding Amelia weren't really her friends—they were more like accessories. Their smiles never quite reached their eyes, and they laughed a half-second too late at her jokes, like they were constantly calculating the right response.

I kept my head down, washing my hands more thoroughly than necessary. Maybe if I just ignored them, they'd get bored and leave.

"I swear, some people just don't understand basic hygiene," Amelia continued, examining her reflection while her followers nodded along.

I finished at the sink and moved toward the paper towels, trying to be invisible.

"Did you guys see that new transfer student today?" one of Amelia's friends asked, clearly trying to change the subject to something more interesting.

"You mean the gorgeous Asian guy?" Amelia's voice perked up with genuine interest. "I definitely noticed him. Those cheekbones could cut glass."

My hands stilled on the paper towel dispenser.

"I heard he's from Seoul University," another friend chimed in. "Apparently his family has serious money."

"Even better," Amelia said, and I could hear the smile in her voice. "I might have to introduce myself. Someone like that shouldn't have to slum it with the usual campus losers."

I felt something cold settle in my stomach. Of course. Of course the most popular girl in school would set her sights on Sunny. That's how these things worked—beautiful people gravitated toward other beautiful people, and the rest of us just watched from the sidelines.

Amelia was exactly the type of girl someone like Sunny should be with. She was confident, sophisticated, came from the right kind of family. She could probably hold actual conversations without nodding like a broken toy. She was everything I could never be.

"I bet he'd be amazing in bed," Amelia said, and her friends dissolved into giggles again. "Foreign guys always have more... experience."

The casual way she talked about it, like Sunny was just another conquest to add to her collection, made my chest burn. She didn't even know him. Didn't know that he played World of Dungeons or that he'd been sweet about my social awkwardness or that sometimes his smile seemed forced in a way that suggested he understood what it felt like to perform happiness.

She just saw a pretty face attached to money and status, which was probably all someone like her ever saw in anyone.

I crumpled the paper towel in my fist. She was such a—

"Slut," I whispered under my breath, so quietly I barely heard it myself.

But somehow, Amelia's head snapped around.

"What did you just say?"

The temperature in the bathroom seemed to drop ten degrees. All conversation stopped, and I could feel every pair of eyes on me. My heart hammered against my ribs as I realized what had just happened.

"I didn't—"

"Jess," Amelia said calmly, not taking her eyes off me.

One of her friends—a tall brunette with arms like a tennis player—stepped forward and grabbed a fistful of my hair. The pain was immediate and sharp as she yanked me down, forcing me to my knees on the cold tile floor.

"Say it again," Jess demanded, her grip tightening. "What did you call her?"

I squeezed my eyes shut, wondering how my day had managed to get even worse. This morning I'd been invisible, and now I was kneeling on a bathroom floor with Amelia Adams staring down at me like I was something she'd scraped off her shoe.

"You're going to regret calling me that," Amelia said, her voice sweet as poison. "Trust me on that."
