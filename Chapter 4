Chapter 4 - "Lunch"
I stared at the array of food options, but my eyes automatically went to the salad bar. The same wilted lettuce and sad tomatoes I always got because it was only a dollar and fifty cents. Safe. Predictable. Within my pathetic budget.

"That's all you want?" Sunny asked, following my gaze. "Just a salad?"

I nodded, already reaching for a container.

He sighed, and there was something almost exasperated in his voice. "Clara, it's my treat. You really don't need to worry about the cost."

"Take him up on it!" Sophie called from across the dining hall, where she was apparently building a small mountain of ribs on her plate. "Girl, you gotta use every advantage you get!"

Sunny laughed at Sophie's shameless enthusiasm, and I felt my resolve waver. My eyes drifted toward the KFC station, where golden fried chicken sat under heat lamps like forbidden treasure. I'd only had it twice—both times when my parents visited and felt guilty enough to splurge on something decent. The memory of that crispy coating and tender meat made my mouth water.

I put down the salad container and walked toward the chicken.

Sunny appeared beside me, studying the menu board. "This what you really wanted?"

I nodded and pointed at menu item four—the chicken sandwich combo that came with fries and a drink. The kind of meal I usually only allowed myself to look at.

"Perfect," he said, stepping up to place the order.

As I turned to find a table, I caught sight of Sunny pulling out his wallet. The card he handed over was sleek and black, with that distinctive weight and finish that looked suspiciously like an American Express Black Card. But that was impossible. No college student had that kind of credit limit.

When we finally sat down with our food, I couldn't help but stare at the spread. My chicken sandwich looked glorious next to its pile of golden fries. Sophie had somehow managed to procure what looked like half the surf-and-turf section—four plates of ribs, steak, and lobster that she was attacking with surgical precision. Sunny had gone for orange chicken with chow mein, eating with the kind of casual elegance that made even cafeteria food look sophisticated.

"So," Sophie said around a bite of lobster, "living in the dorms?"

Sunny shook his head. "Got my own place off campus. My father thought it would be better for me to have some independence."

"Lucky. These dorms are basically glorified prison cells." Sophie gestured with a rib bone. "How are you adjusting? This your first time in America?"

"Actually, no. I spent summers in California when I was younger, so I'm not completely lost." He smiled, but something about it seemed practiced. "Though the campus culture here is definitely different from Seoul University."

"I bet. Clara and I have been stuck together since we were five, so we're basically experts on American mediocrity by now."

Since preschool, actually, but I wasn't about to correct her out loud. Sophie had been my anchor through every awkward phase, every social disaster, every time my parents made it clear that I was disappointing them in new and creative ways.

"That's a long friendship," Sunny said, glancing at me. "You're lucky to have each other."

"Clara's the best," Sophie said loyally. "Even if other people don't always see it right away. She's got this whole mysterious thing going on that throws people off."

I shifted uncomfortably. Sophie was being kind, but we both knew the truth—people didn't find me mysterious. They found me weird. The girl who couldn't make eye contact, who mumbled when she spoke, who ate lunch alone until Sophie took pity on her in elementary school.

"I think she's got a really pretty face," Sunny said casually, taking a bite of his orange chicken. "Some people just take longer to open up."

My cheeks burned. He was just being nice. That's what decent people did—they said nice things to make others feel better. It didn't mean anything.

"Right?" Sophie beamed. "I keep telling her that, but she never believes me."

"Confidence is hard," Sunny agreed. "Especially when you're naturally introverted."

Sophie studied him with renewed interest. "Speaking of confidence—how'd you get so put together? Like, you're obviously smart, you're clearly in good shape, and you've got that whole thing going on." She gestured vaguely at his face.

Sunny laughed, but there was something hollow about it. "Lots of practice. And lots of motivation to not disappoint people."

"Asian parents?"

"Something like that." His smile flickered for just a moment. "Let's just say failure wasn't really an option growing up. All those stereotypical Asian beatings really do make you better at everything."

Sophie snorted with laughter. "Oh god, my parents just threatened to take away my allowance."

"Lucky you," Sunny said, and while his tone was light, something in his eyes suggested he wasn't entirely joking.

I found myself studying his face more carefully. He was smiling, laughing at Sophie's stories, engaging in the kind of easy conversation that I'd never been able to manage. But occasionally, when he thought no one was looking, that smile seemed to require effort. Like he was performing being happy rather than actually feeling it.

Maybe I was reading too much into it. Maybe this was just how confident people looked up close—polished on the surface but still human underneath.

"What about you?" Sophie asked. "Family back in Seoul?"

"Just my father now," Sunny said simply. "He's the one with the big corporate job that dragged us over here."

There was something in the way he said "just my father" that made me wonder what had happened to his mother, but Sophie seemed to pick up on the subtle boundary and shifted topics.

"Well, Clara's parents are..." She glanced at me apologetically. "Let's say they have very high expectations."

I focused intently on my chicken sandwich. That was one way to put it. Another way would be to say they'd made it clear that their quiet, socially awkward daughter was a constant source of embarrassment and frustration.

"Parents," Sunny said with understanding. "Sometimes I think they forget we're actual people instead of just extensions of their own ambitions."

The conversation continued flowing around me while I mostly listened, occasionally nodding when directly addressed. Sophie and Sunny seemed to click effortlessly, trading stories and jokes like they'd known each other for years instead of twenty minutes. I felt like a spectator watching some kind of social ballet that I'd never learned the steps to.

But Sunny kept glancing at me throughout their conversation, including me with a smile or a direct comment, making sure I didn't completely disappear into the background. It was thoughtful in a way that made my chest feel tight.

Eventually, he checked his phone and frowned. "I hate to cut this short, but I've got Advanced Algorithms in ten minutes."

My heart did that stupid skipping thing again. This was ending. This perfect, impossible lunch where someone like him had sat with someone like me and acted like it was completely natural.

This was my first real interaction with a guy in forever.
