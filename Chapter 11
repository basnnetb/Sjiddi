Chapter 11 - "Breaking the Bubble 2"
The walk had been quiet, with Sunny leading me through paths I didn't even know existed on campus. We'd moved away from the main walkways, past the academic buildings, until the sounds of students and traffic faded into something softer. Now I found myself sitting on a bench overlooking the small river that wound through the edge of campus, watching sunlight dance across the water.

It was beautiful here. Peaceful in a way that made the constant knot of anxiety in my chest loosen slightly.

"I found this place my first week here," Sunny said, settling beside me on the bench. "No one really comes this way. It's perfect when you need to think, or just... breathe."

There was something in his voice that made me glance at him. He was looking out at the water, and for a moment that perfectly composed mask he always wore seemed to slip just slightly. Like he understood what it felt like to need a place to escape to.

"We haven't known each other very long," he continued, turning to face me. "And I know we don't really know much about each other yet. But I'd like us to be friends. Real friends."

The sincerity in his voice caught me off guard. I'd expected him to ask about my nose, about what had happened, maybe even about what he'd seen at the coffee shop this morning. Instead, he was talking about friendship like it was something precious, something worth protecting.

He ran a hand through his hair, and when he spoke again, his voice was quieter, more vulnerable than I'd ever heard it. "I told you yesterday that I have trouble making friends, and that's... partially true. I can make friends easily enough—that's not the hard part. But real friends? People who actually care about you as a person instead of what you can do for them? That's much harder."

My heart started beating faster as I watched him struggle with words the way I always did. It was strange seeing someone so effortlessly confident suddenly seem uncertain.

"The time I've spent with you—just this one day, really—I've enjoyed it more than any friendship I've had in years. You don't want anything from me. You don't care about my family or my grades or what I can offer you. You just... you're just yourself."

Heat flooded my cheeks as his words sank in. Despite my complete inability to function like a normal human being, despite my social anxiety and my awkward silences and my tendency to fall apart at the worst possible moments, he actually enjoyed my company. The thought was almost too overwhelming to process.

He reached out and gently touched my shoulder, drawing my attention back to his face. "So please, Clara. Let me be your friend."

The directness of the request, combined with the warmth in his eyes, made something inside me settle into place. This feeling—this sense of being seen and accepted—was something I'd only ever experienced with Sophie. But here was Sunny, offering the same thing, and suddenly I could speak.

"Yes," I said, and while my voice was still small, it was clear. "Of course we can be friends."

His smile was radiant, transforming his entire face in a way that made my chest tight. "I'm glad," he said. "Really glad. It's been a long time since I've had someone I could just... be myself with."

There was relief in his voice that I recognized, the same feeling I got when Sophie accepted all my weirdness without question. Like he'd been carrying around the same kind of loneliness I knew so well.

But then his expression grew more serious, and he leaned forward slightly. "Now that we're friends, though, I want to help you with whatever happened. Someone hurt you, and badly. I can see it's not just your nose—you're scared of something."

I opened my mouth, then closed it again. The automatic instinct to deflect, to minimize, to pretend everything was fine warred with something new—the desire to trust him. My mind raced back to this morning, to the way he'd masterfully deflected all of Amelia's advances without being cruel about it. The way his expression had turned cold the moment she was gone, like he'd been performing politeness rather than feeling it.

Maybe he would understand. Maybe he'd even know what to do about someone like her.

"Amelia," I said finally, the name feeling heavy on my tongue. "Amelia Adams."
