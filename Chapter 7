Chapter 7 - "Breakdown"
I stared at the ground, my vision blurring with fresh tears. The words were there, somewhere in my throat, but they felt stuck behind a wall I couldn't break through.

Sunny sighed, running his hands through his perfect hair before settling back down beside me. "It's okay if you don't want to talk about it," he said quietly.

The kindness in his voice only made me cry harder. Why couldn't I just function like a normal person? Why couldn't I just tell him what happened, or thank him for being here, or do anything other than sit here like a broken mess?

"I understand," he continued, and something in his tone was different—softer, more vulnerable. "Maybe not exactly what happened to you, but... I understand what it feels like when you can't do anything. When you feel completely powerless." He paused. "You don't have to say anything. I'll just be here."

That's when something inside me snapped.

He understood? He understood what it felt like to be powerless? This perfect specimen of human being who looked like he'd stepped out of a magazine, who was clearly brilliant enough to have his code featured in college courses, who probably had more money in his wallet than I made in six months? What could he possibly understand about feeling helpless?

And why was he even here? This wasn't some romantic movie where the beautiful guy just happened to stumble across the broken girl at exactly the right moment. He had to have been looking for me, or following me, or—god, did he see me as some kind of charity case? Some pathetic creature that needed rescuing?

I pulled my hood down and turned to face him fully, my broken nose throbbing with the movement.

"What would you know?" The words came out sharper than I'd intended, cutting through the air between us.

Sunny's eyes widened slightly at my sudden directness, but his voice remained gentle. "I don't know exactly, but I—"

"No." I put my hand on his shoulder, surprising both of us. "Why are you even talking to me?" My voice was getting louder, all the frustration and pain and confusion pouring out at once. "You're handsome and perfect and smart and rich and you could be friends with anyone on this entire campus. So why are you sitting here acting like we've known each other for years?"

He opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out.

"Why is everyone so fake?" The words were tumbling out now, unstoppable. "Why am I always someone's charity project? Sophie feels sorry for me, you feel sorry for me, even the professors look at me like I'm some kind of wounded animal they need to handle carefully."

Tears streamed down my face, mixing with the dried blood around my nose. "And why do people pick on me? What did I ever do to deserve getting my face smashed in a bathroom because I exist? Why can't I just have one normal conversation without wanting to disappear? Why can't I just be a functioning human being instead of whatever this is?"

I gestured wildly at myself, my voice cracking. "Why can't I get anything right? Why does everything I touch turn to shit? Why can't I even talk to someone who's being nice to me without completely falling apart?"

Sunny sat there in stunned silence, watching me unravel completely. I was dimly aware that people were probably staring, that I was making a scene, but I couldn't stop.

"I can't even order food without panicking! I can't make friends! I can't talk to my own parents without disappointing them! I can't do anything right and now I can't even—"

The reality of what I was doing hit me like a physical blow. I was screaming at Sunny. Sweet, patient Sunny who had done nothing but try to be kind to me. Who had offered to pay for lunch and played with me and sat with me when I was crying on a bench like a lunatic.

My face burned with mortification as the words died in my throat. He was staring at me with a mixture of concern and confusion, probably wondering what kind of psycho he'd gotten himself mixed up with.

I couldn't stay here. Couldn't look at his face and see the moment he realized I was exactly as broken as everyone said I was.

I bolted.

My legs carried me across the quad without conscious thought, my lungs burning as I ran. I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears, drowning out everything else.

I finally stopped behind the library, doubling over to catch my breath. The tears started again, harder this time, wracking sobs that made my broken nose ache.

What was wrong with me? He'd been trying to comfort me. He was probably just walking by and saw me crying and decided to be a decent human being. And I'd repaid his kindness by having a complete meltdown and yelling at him like he was responsible for every bad thing that had ever happened to me.

God, he must think I'm insane. He'd probably tell everyone about the crazy girl who screamed at him for no reason. Not that it mattered—after today, he'd never want to talk to me again anyway.

How could I face him in calculus tomorrow? How could I sit in the same room and pretend this hadn't happened? How could I look him in the eye knowing I'd completely destroyed any chance of... what? Friendship? Something more?

I slid down the brick wall until I was sitting on the ground, hugging my knees to my chest. Maybe I could just stay here forever. Maybe I could disappear entirely and save everyone the trouble of having to deal with me.

Why couldn't I just function like a normal human adult?
