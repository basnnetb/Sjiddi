Chapter 2 - "Transfer 2"
I caught my reflection in the bathroom mirror one last time before leaving. Still a disaster, but maybe slightly less of one than this morning. My hair at least looked like it belonged to a human being now instead of something that had been struck by lightning.

As I headed toward CSC 497, I tried to give myself a pep talk. Next time I saw Sunny—if there was a next time—I'd actually speak in complete sentences. Maybe even ask a question. How hard could it be?

My mind drifted back to him without permission. That perfect jawline, the way his voice had this smooth quality that made everything sound important. And god, he smelled incredible—like expensive cologne mixed with something clean and warm. I'd caught a glimpse of his arms when he'd reached for his notebook too. The way his shirt stretched across his biceps suggested he did way more than just study all day.

I found myself imagining what the rest of him looked like, constructing a perfect body to match that perfect face, all lean muscle and—

I slammed directly into someone coming around the corner.

My backpack hit the ground, spilling notebooks and pens everywhere. I dropped to my knees immediately, scrambling to collect everything while heat flooded my cheeks.

"Sorry," I whispered, not daring to look up.

"Watch where you're going next time," came a sharp voice above me. Footsteps clicked away before I could even process what had happened.

Great. Just great. That girl sounded pissed, and now she probably thought I was some kind of walking hazard. Way to go, Clara. Perfect way to ruin a perfectly good fantasy about—

I shook my head, focusing on getting to class. CSC 497 was going to be a long three hours, especially since I hadn't done any of the prep work. Again. At least I could lose myself in World of Dungeons while Professor Martinez droned on about algorithms I should already know.

The classroom was packed when I arrived, so I claimed my usual spot in the very back corner where I could disappear. I booted up the game as soon as I sat down, diving into the familiar comfort of my guild's latest raid. The new boss fight required serious concentration, and I had gear to optimize.

I was deep in the zone, fingers flying across the keyboard as I managed my character's rotation, when a voice next to me made me jump.

"I didn't know you played World of Dungeons too."

I knew that voice. My heart did something complicated as I turned to see Sunny settling into the seat beside me, that devastating smile directed at my computer screen instead of me. Which was probably for the best, since I could feel my face turning red.

"Your gear is insane," he continued, leaning closer to get a better look. "That's some serious dedication right there."

I managed a nod, trying not to think about how good he smelled or how close he was sitting.

"What's your gamertag?" he asked. "Think you'd be willing to carry a newbie? I just started playing and I'm pretty terrible at it."

My heart hammered against my ribs. Why was someone like him asking someone like me for help? And more importantly, why was someone who clearly had his life together wasting time on games during class?

He must have noticed my confused expression because he shrugged casually. "I already know all this stuff. Actually, one of the code examples Martinez uses is something I wrote. So this is basically just a filler class for me."

Of course it was. Of course he was brilliant enough to have his code featured in class materials. What the hell was I even doing here?

"So, would you mind helping me out?" he asked again, and there was something almost shy in his voice that didn't match his perfect everything else.

I opened my mouth to actually respond with words this time, but nothing came out. Instead, I found myself nodding again like some kind of broken bobblehead.

"Awesome," he said, pulling out his laptop. "Fair warning—I'm probably going to get us both killed."

For the next hour, I guided him through basic dungeon mechanics, trying not to hyperanalyze every casual comment he made. He was surprisingly good at picking things up, asking smart questions about strategy and gear optimization. And he actually seemed to be enjoying himself, laughing when his character inevitably died to easily avoidable mechanics.

This was perfect. This was how relationships started, right? Bonding over shared interests, spending time together, slowly building something real. Maybe I could suggest we grab coffee after class. Maybe we could meet up to play together sometime. Maybe—

"Thanks for this," he said during a brief respite between fights. "It's nice to have someone to play with."

I looked over at him, taking in his genuine smile and the way he seemed completely relaxed despite being surrounded by classmates. Why was he talking to me? I glanced around the room and noticed every other seat was taken. Maybe that explained it. Or maybe this was fate. Maybe the universe was finally rewarding my complete lack of social skills with the perfect man.

I took a deep breath, summoning every ounce of courage I possessed. I was going to do it. I was going to ask him to lunch.

"Lunch," I managed to whisper.

He paused his game and looked at me, eyebrows raised slightly. "Are you asking if I want to have lunch with you?"

I nodded, probably too enthusiastically.

His smile widened. "You know, I've never actually been asked out by a girl before. Of course I'd love to."

Asked out. He thought I was asking him out. Which, technically, I guess I was, but hearing him say it made my face burn with embarrassment and something that felt dangerously close to hope.

I turned back to my screen, continuing to carry him through the dungeon while my mind spun in circles. This was happening. I was having lunch with Sunny. Maybe I was completely delusional for thinking someone like him could be interested in someone like me, but I didn't care.

I was in love, and for once in my life, it felt like maybe the universe was on my side.
