Chapter 8 - "Breakdown 2"
The hot water had felt good against my skin, washing away the dried blood and the lingering ache of humiliation. But now, standing in front of the mirror with a towel wrapped around me, I couldn't avoid the damage anymore.

My nose definitely looked wrong. The bridge sat at a slight angle, bending to the left in a way that made my whole face seem off-balance. I'd have to go to the campus health center, fill out forms, explain what happened to nurses and doctors and whoever else wanted to poke at my face and ask uncomfortable questions.

I grabbed one of the butterfly bandages from our first aid kit and carefully positioned it across the bridge of my nose. It wasn't perfect, but unless someone really looked closely, they might not notice anything was wrong.

Back in my room, I pulled on my usual pajamas and glanced out the window. The campus was dark and quiet—it was already past midnight. My laptop sat open on my desk, notifications blinking from the two assignments that were due at 1 AM. Assignments I hadn't even started.

I slumped into my desk chair and opened ChatGPT. It wouldn't give me a good grade, but a mediocre AI-generated response was better than nothing. Twenty minutes later, both assignments were submitted, and I'd set up a macro to keep my game character running overnight. At least I'd wake up to some decent loot.

I collapsed into bed, my mind still spinning with images of Sunny's confused face as I'd screamed at him for no reason. But exhaustion won out eventually, and I fell into a dreamless sleep.

The sound of my alarm felt different somehow when it went off at 7 AM. Instead of the usual bone-deep fatigue that made getting out of bed feel impossible, I actually felt... alert? Awake? It was strange—I normally dragged myself through mornings like a zombie until at least 10 AM.

I sat up and stretched, checking my phone for my overnight gaming progress. The macro had worked perfectly, and my character had gained three levels while I slept. Small victories.

In the bathroom mirror, I examined my reflection more carefully. Despite the bandage and the slight swelling around my nose, I looked... not terrible? My skin seemed clearer somehow, and my hair had dried in a way that almost looked intentional instead of just messy.

Sunny's voice echoed in my memory—something about me having a pretty face. I shook my head immediately. He was just being nice. That's what decent people did when they saw someone crying. And after yesterday's meltdown, he probably never wanted to see me again anyway.

But I found myself spending more time with my hair, working it into something that looked almost like a deliberate style. It reminded me of those wolf cuts I'd seen on Instagram—not perfect, but definitely better than my usual chaos.

My eyes drifted to Sophie's makeup kit sitting on the counter. She'd left it out after getting ready for her date with Marcus yesterday. I'd never been much for makeup—what was the point when no one looked at me anyway?—but something made me pause.

Who was I getting ready for, though? It wasn't like anyone would notice if I put in effort. Especially not after I'd basically had a psychotic break in front of the one person who'd shown any interest in talking to me.

I left the makeup alone and headed back to the living room, fully dressed with nearly an hour to kill before Sophie usually woke up. This never happened—I was always rushing around at the last minute, throwing on whatever clothes were closest and hoping I could grab coffee on the way to class.

I settled onto our tiny couch, but my mind wouldn't quiet down. Yesterday kept replaying on loop, but not just the breakdown. Something about Sunny had been bothering me, some detail I couldn't quite pin down.

He was perfect. Almost aggressively perfect, if that made sense. The kind of perfect that seemed almost calculated—perfect grades, perfect body, perfect manners, perfect responses to every social situation. Even his flaws seemed designed to make him more appealing, like admitting he was "new" to World of Dungeons when he'd clearly picked up the mechanics faster than players who'd been at it for months.

And what were the odds that he'd just happened to be walking by that exact bench at that exact moment? Brighton College wasn't small, but it wasn't huge either. Still, the timing seemed almost too convenient.

Maybe I was being paranoid. Maybe perfect people actually existed, and I was so unused to anyone being genuinely nice to me that I was looking for hidden motives where none existed.

Or maybe I was just trying to find reasons to push him away before he could decide I wasn't worth his time.

"Clara?"

I jumped as Sophie's hand landed on my shoulder. I'd been so lost in thought that I hadn't heard her come out of her room.

She was staring at my face, her expression shifting from sleepy confusion to sharp concern. "What the hell happened to your nose?"

"Amelia," I said simply.

Sophie's face darkened. "That bitch. She's going to pay for this."

"It's fine," I said, though we both knew it wasn't. "It's not like we can really do anything about her anyway."

Sophie's jaw tightened, but she nodded reluctantly. We both knew the score—Thomas Adams had enough money and influence to make problems disappear, and that protection extended to his daughter. Filing a complaint would only make things worse for me in the long run.

"Well," Sophie said after a moment, her tone deliberately lighter, "why don't we start the day, huh? You're up early for once—might as well make the most of it."
