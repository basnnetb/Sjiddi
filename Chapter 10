Chapter 10 - "Breaking the Bubble"
By the time I reached the math building, my lungs felt like they were on fire. I had to stop just outside the entrance to catch my breath, hands on my knees as I tried to pull myself together. The morning's events kept replaying in my head—the way Sunny's expression had completely shifted after Amelia left, that cold, irritated look that seemed so at odds with everything I thought I knew about him. And then he'd seen me. Seen us hiding behind that bench like a couple of deranged stalkers.

After yesterday's complete meltdown and now this morning's spy session, there was no way he didn't think I was completely unhinged.

The warning bell rang, and I forced myself to move. I slipped through the classroom door just as Professor Chen was starting to close it, earning a disapproving look that I pretended not to see. My usual seat in the back corner felt like a sanctuary as I collapsed into it, tilting my head back and closing my eyes. At least I was here. At least I'd managed that much.

"You seem tired."

The familiar voice made my stomach flip. I opened my eyes to find myself automatically responding with a soft "yeah" before my brain could catch up and remind me that I was supposed to be mortified.

Then I actually looked at him, and my breath caught. There was that beautiful smile again, warm and genuine, his hair falling perfectly across his forehead like he'd just stepped out of a magazine. No trace of the cold expression I'd seen at the coffee shop.

I quickly turned my face down, feeling heat flood my cheeks.

"Did you go on a morning run or something?" he asked, and there was gentle amusement in his voice.

My mind raced. Was he messing with me? He had to have seen Sophie and me at the coffee shop. There was no way he hadn't. But he was acting like nothing had happened, like we were just continuing our normal conversation from yesterday. I managed a small nod, not trusting my voice.

He was quiet for a moment, and when he spoke again, his tone was softer, more thoughtful. "You're so much cuter when you actually talk, you know. Like yesterday."

My face burned even hotter as the memory of my complete breakdown came flooding back. All that screaming, all those accusations I'd hurled at him when he'd been trying to help. I turned to face him, the words tumbling out before I could stop them.

"Sorry," I whispered, barely audible even to myself.

The gentle pressure of his hand on my back made me tense up, but his voice was reassuring. "It's okay. You seemed really hurt yesterday. That's what friends do, right? We look out for each other."

Friends. The word hit me like a physical blow, but not in a bad way. When had that happened? When had we become friends? I found myself nodding, not because I understood, but because I wanted it to be true.

Professor Chen's voice droned on in the background, something about polynomial functions that I should probably be paying attention to. But I couldn't seem to make myself care about math when Sunny was sitting right there, when he'd just called us friends, when he seemed to have forgiven my insane behavior from yesterday.

I kept glancing over at him, watching the way he took notes with that same precise handwriting, the way he occasionally stretched his neck or adjusted his position in his chair. The strange energy I'd woken up with was still coursing through me, making it impossible to do my usual trick of sleeping through class.

The third time I looked over, he was looking back. Our eyes met for just a second before I whipped my head around, staring down at my blank notebook like it contained the secrets of the universe.

I heard him laugh quietly, and then his voice was closer, more serious. "What happened to your face?"

My hand instinctively went to the bandage on my nose. "Nothing," I mumbled.

"Clara." There was something different in his tone now, more focused. "Yesterday you had a bloody nose, but this... it's broken, isn't it?"

I nodded reluctantly, still not looking at him.

"Yeah," I said, the word barely a breath.

I felt rather than saw him move closer, and then his hand was covering mine where it rested on the desk. The contact sent electricity up my arm, and I couldn't help the small shiver that ran through me.

"Let's get out of here," he said, and there was something in his voice I couldn't quite identify. Determination, maybe. Or anger.

My brain was screaming questions—what was he doing, why was he holding my hand, what did he mean by getting out of here—but my body seemed to have other ideas. I found myself standing up, gathering my things, following him toward the door while Professor Chen continued his lecture, oblivious to our departure.

As we stepped into the hallway, I finally found my voice. "What are we doing?"
