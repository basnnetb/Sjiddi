Chapter 0 - "Clara Evans"
The reflection staring back at me wasn't exactly inspiring. My black hair stuck out at odd angles, defying any attempt at order, and the bags under my eyes told the story of another late night spent grinding through raids instead of studying. The pile of laundry on my chair had somehow migrated to the floor overnight, and my engineering textbooks sat untouched on my desk, buried under empty energy drink cans.

Second week of senior year at Brighton College, and already I felt like I was drowning.

I'd foolishly thought this year might be different somehow. Maybe I'd finally figure out how to be a real person, make more friends, actually pass my classes without scraping by on the curve. Instead, here I was, same as always—just me and Sophie against the world, working a job that paid me barely enough to afford ramen, watching everyone else seem to have their lives figured out.

The shower was quick and utilitarian. No point in trying too hard when baggy jeans and an oversized hoodie were going to be my uniform anyway. As I grabbed my backpack, the door across the hall opened.

Sophie emerged looking like she'd actually put effort into existing today—her blonde hair fell in neat waves, and she'd managed to coordinate an outfit that didn't look like she'd grabbed it blindfolded from a thrift store clearance rack.

She took one look at me and sighed. "Do you ever plan on dressing like you're actually part of the human species?"

I shrugged, adjusting my backpack strap. "That would require being human first."

"Oh, come on." She bumped my shoulder as we started walking down the hallway. "You know you're actually really pretty when you're not actively trying to blend into the background, right?"

"Pretty sure that's just your rose-colored glasses talking."

"My rose-colored glasses don't lie." She pulled out her phone to check something. "Unlike certain people who claim they're going to study and then spend six hours raiding dungeons."

Heat crept up my neck. "I did study. For like... twenty minutes."

"Clara."

"Okay, fine, I'm completely screwed for the calculus exam. Happy?"

She laughed, the sound echoing off the empty corridor walls. "At least you're consistent."

We pushed through the doors into the crisp morning air. The campus was already buzzing with students who looked far more awake and put-together than I felt. Sophie checked her phone again, and I caught a glimpse of a text thread filled with heart emojis.

"So," I said, "how was last night? Did Marcus survive meeting your study group?"

A smile tugged at the corner of her mouth. "He brought coffee for everyone and actually knew what he was talking about during our discussion on organic chemistry. I think Jenny's officially smitten."

"With your boyfriend?"

"With the fact that my boyfriend isn't a complete disaster." She glanced at me sideways. "Unlike some people I know who refuse to even acknowledge when cute guys exist."

"Cute guys don't exactly line up to talk to the girl who looks like she crawled out of a cave."

"That's a choice, not a fact."

We walked in comfortable silence for a bit, weaving between clusters of students. Sophie had this way of making everything seem normal, like my complete inability to function as an adult was just a quirky personality trait instead of a slowly unfolding disaster.

"I should probably actually go to office hours," I said as we approached the math building.

"Probably, yeah. Professor Chen might actually help if you show up looking like you care."

"Bold assumption."

She stopped at the building entrance. "This is where I leave you to face the music. Try not to sleep through the entire lecture?"

"No promises."

Sophie headed toward her psychology building, and I felt that familiar weight settle on my shoulders—the one that appeared whenever I had to navigate the world without her buffer. I kept my head down as I climbed the stairs to the third floor, avoiding eye contact with anyone who might mistake me for someone worth talking to.

The classroom was already half full when I slipped in. I made a beeline for the back corner, sliding into a seat where I could disappear into the wall if needed. Professor Chen was writing equations on the whiteboard, his voice a steady drone that seemed designed to induce unconsciousness.

Perfect. I folded my arms on the desk and let my head sink down onto them. The familiar hum of the air conditioning mixed with Chen's lecture created a white noise that felt like a lullaby. My eyes drifted shut almost immediately.

The next thing I knew, I was blinking awake to the sound of voices near the front of the room. My neck was stiff, and there was probably a crease on my cheek from where it had been pressed against my sleeve. I lifted my head slowly, trying to orient myself.

That's when I saw him.

Standing near Professor Chen's desk, apparently asking about seating arrangements, was quite possibly the most beautiful human being I'd ever seen in person. Asian features, dark hair that somehow managed to look effortlessly styled, and shoulders that suggested he did more than just sit in libraries all day. Even from the back of the classroom, I could hear the confident tone in his voice as he spoke with Chen about finding an available spot.

I blinked hard, wondering if I was still dreaming.

Who the hell was that?
