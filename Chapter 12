Chapter 12 - "Breaking the Bubble 3"
"Amelia."

The way he repeated her name made something cold run down my spine. There was a flatness to his tone that reminded me of the expression I'd seen on his face after she'd walked away from their coffee date—like he was filing away information for later use.

"What are you going to do?" I asked softly, suddenly worried about what I might have set in motion.

He turned back to me with that familiar warm smile, but it took a moment longer to reach his eyes than usual. "I'll report her to student services for bullying. There have to be procedures for this kind of thing."

I sighed, feeling the familiar weight of helplessness settle back on my shoulders. "That won't work. Her father basically owns half the college's board of trustees. She's untouchable."

Sunny sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Of course it won't be that easy."

He studied me for what felt like a long time, his dark eyes searching my face in a way that made me shift uncomfortably on the bench.

"What?" I asked, unable to meet his gaze.

"It's just nice hearing your voice instead of those little nods you do," he said, and there was genuine warmth in his observation. "You have more to say than you think."

That made me pause. When had speaking to him become so... easy? I'd just had an entire conversation without my usual tongue-tied panic, without calculating every word before it left my mouth. The realization was almost as unsettling as it was liberating.

"I guess," I said, testing the feeling.

Sunny leaned back against the bench, seemingly relaxed, but when he spoke again there was something carefully casual about his tone. "What were you doing at the coffee shop this morning, anyway?"

My stomach dropped. So he had seen us. "Nothing," I said quietly, feeling heat creep up my neck.

"You should have come over and said hello," he continued, like my obvious evasion didn't bother him at all. "I could have bought you a drink or something."

"I'll keep that in mind," I managed.

"Amelia actually contacted me yesterday," he said, as if we were discussing the weather. "Asked if I wanted to meet for coffee before classes started."

There was something in the way he said it that made me look at him more closely. His expression had shifted again, that mask of politeness falling away to reveal something harder underneath.

"She's a bitch," he said bluntly. "Spent more time checking out my body than actually listening to anything I said. Acting like a complete slut."

The harsh words coming from someone who was usually so carefully polite caught me off guard, but they also sparked something vindictive in my chest. "Of course she was," I said, surprising myself with the venom in my voice. "She's a massive slut."

Sunny laughed, but there was no humor in it. "How many guys has she been with, anyway?"

I shivered at the thought of all the stories I'd heard over the years, all the photos and videos that had circulated through social media, all the bragging she'd done about her conquests. "That number is probably higher than the total enrollment here."

"Holy shit," Sunny said, sitting forward in shock. "Are you serious?"

"She doesn't even limit herself to one at a time," I said, the words tumbling out before I could stop them. "Sometimes she'll have multiple guys over for... parties."

Sunny actually looked nauseated, his face going slightly green before he sat back down heavily. "Jesus. She's like a walking stereotype, isn't she? Rich daddy's girl who thinks the world revolves around her and her body count."

I nodded, feeling a strange sense of relief at having someone finally understand what Amelia was really like beneath all that perfect packaging.

"Hey," Sunny said, his tone brightening as he seemed to shake off the disgust. "I have soccer tryouts in a bit. We don't have CSC today, and unless you have other classes... want to come watch? It'll only take about an hour."

I glanced at my phone. Sophie and I were supposed to meet for coffee later, but honestly, this sounded infinitely better than our usual routine of her trying to convince me to be more social while I nodded along uncomfortably.

"Yeah," I said, surprising myself again. "I don't have anything else to do."

His smile was brilliant, transforming his whole face in a way that made my heart skip. "Great. You know, I really do enjoy actually talking to you. It's refreshing."

"I just have a hard time speaking around people I don't trust," I admitted.

"Does that mean you trust me?" he asked, and there was something vulnerable in the question that made me want to reassure him.

"Maybe," I said, which earned me another laugh.

"I'll take it," he said, standing up and offering me his hand. "Tryouts start in ten minutes, but we could grab that coffee on the way if you want."

I took his hand, letting him pull me to my feet, and felt something warm settle in my chest. For the first time in longer than I could remember, I was genuinely happy. Not the fake happiness I performed for Sophie or my parents, but real contentment. I'd finally made a new friend—a handsome, intelligent, interesting friend who seemed to actually enjoy my company despite all my flaws.

Maybe things were finally starting to look up.
