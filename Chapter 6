Chapter 6 - "Amelia Adams 2"
Warning: Chapter contains physical abuse

The grip on my hair tightened, and I bit back a whimper as Jess forced my head further down. The cold tile pressed against my knees through my jeans.

"You know what I love about freaks like you?" Amelia's voice was conversational, like we were discussing the weather. "You think you can just mumble your little insults and hide behind your equally pathetic friend."

Another girl—I think her name was Madison—kicked my backpack, sending my notebooks skittering across the floor. "Speaking of that friend, isn't it funny how people avoid her now? Ever since she started hanging around with you?"

My stomach clenched. Sophie had never said anything, but I'd noticed how conversations died when we approached groups, how invitations dried up after people realized we were a package deal.

"Such a shame," Amelia continued, crouching down so she was at eye level with me. "Sophie used to be almost normal before she decided to adopt the campus charity case."

I tried to keep my face blank, but Amelia's smile sharpened like she'd seen something flicker in my expression.

"Oh, that hit a nerve, didn't it? You know it's true. Poor Sophie, dragged down by her pet project." She tilted her head with mock sympathy. "Kind of like what happened with Danny Richardson, remember?"

My blood turned to ice. Danny had been my crush sophomore year of high school—sweet, quiet, into the same books I liked. I'd worked up the courage to talk to him exactly three times before Amelia decided he'd make an interesting distraction.

"He was so easy," she said, her voice dropping to a whisper only I could hear. "One party, a few drinks, and suddenly he was much more interested in what I had to offer. The photos I sent you afterward were just... well, I wanted to make sure you really understood."

My hands clenched into fists. She'd made sure I saw everything—every message, every intimate photo, proof that the boy I'd been dreaming about had forgotten I existed the moment someone better came along.

"But that's ancient history," Amelia said, straightening up. "What really pisses me off is how you get to coast through life being a complete waste of space while daddy's money keeps flowing in."

Madison laughed. "Right? Like, at least when we screw up, we have to work for forgiveness."

"Clara just gets to exist," Jess added, giving my hair another painful yank. "Same allowance, same support, doesn't matter how much of a disappointment she is."

I wanted to tell them they were wrong, that my parents made their disappointment crystal clear at every opportunity, but the words wouldn't come. They never did when I needed them most.

"Nothing to say?" Amelia asked. "How typical."

That's when Madison's hand connected with the side of my face, hard enough to make my ears ring. Then Jess shoved me forward, and my palms scraped against the tile as I tried to catch myself. Someone's foot caught me in the ribs, and I curled inward, trying to protect myself.

"Pathetic," one of them muttered.

"No wonder you eat lunch alone," said another.

The final blow came from Madison again, her fist connecting with my nose. The crack was audible, and pain exploded across my face. Blood started flowing immediately, warm and metallic.

"Shit," Madison hissed. "I think I—"

"We need to go," Amelia said sharply. "Now."

I heard the clicking of heels against tile, the bathroom door swinging shut, and then silence.

I stayed on the floor for a long moment, trying to process what had just happened. My nose throbbed with each heartbeat, and I could taste blood in my mouth. When I finally pushed myself up and looked in the mirror, I barely recognized my reflection.

My nose sat at an odd angle, blood streaking down to my chin. My hair stuck out at crazy angles where Jess had grabbed it, and there was a red handprint blooming across my left cheek. I looked exactly like what I was—a victim.

The tears started then, hot and angry and useless. I pulled my hoodie up, trying to hide the damage, and stumbled out of the bathroom.

I couldn't go to class like this. Couldn't sit in Algebraic Topology and pretend everything was fine while my face screamed otherwise. Instead, I headed back toward the dorms, keeping my head down and hoping no one would look too closely.

But my mind kept spinning, playing out scenarios I didn't want to imagine. Amelia would find a way to get close to Sunny—she always got what she wanted. She'd charm him with her perfect smile and her confidence, and once she learned he knew me, she'd find new ways to twist the knife. Maybe she'd sleep with him and send me photos again, just to remind me of my place in the world.

I found a bench near the quad and collapsed onto it, pulling my knees up to my chest. Why was my life always like this? Why did every good thing get poisoned before I could even enjoy it?

A light touch on my shoulder made me flinch.

"Hey."

I knew that voice. My heart hammered as I turned slightly to see Sunny settling onto the bench beside me. Of all the people to find me like this, it had to be him. I quickly looked away, trying to angle my face so he couldn't see the damage.

"What happened?" His voice was gentle, but there was something underneath it that made me glance at him despite myself.

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. How could I explain? How could I tell him that the girl who was probably going to ask him out later had just used my face as a punching bag?

Sunny stood up and moved directly in front of me, forcing me to meet his eyes. When he saw my face clearly, his expression darkened in a way I'd never seen before.

"Who did this to you?" he asked again, and this time his voice was deadly serious.
