Chapter 1 - "Transfer"
I stared down at my blank notebook, the single equation I'd managed to scribble before falling asleep mocking me from the page. People like him didn't notice people like me. That was just the natural order of things—beautiful, confident people existed in their own orbit while the rest of us floated around in the background, completely invisible.

My stomach chose that moment to remind me I'd skipped breakfast again. Maybe I could grab something from the vending machine after class, assuming I had enough quarters left in my backpack. The sad remains of my part-time paycheck weren't exactly—

A light touch on my shoulder made my entire body freeze.

No. No no no. This wasn't happening. My mind immediately spiraled through every horrible possibility: I was in someone's seat, I'd accidentally taken someone's pen, my hair looked even worse than I thought, I smelled like the energy drinks I'd been living on—

I turned around slowly, and there he was.

Up close, he was devastatingly beautiful in a way that made my brain temporarily stop functioning. His jawline could have been carved by someone who took geometry very seriously, and his dark eyes had this warmth to them that somehow made me feel like I was melting and freezing at the same time. His skin was flawless—actually flawless, not the kind of flawless that required good lighting and filters. I could even see the faint outline of veins along his neck, which was somehow both vulnerable and incredibly attractive.

"Hello? Anyone home in there?" His voice was smooth, with just a hint of amusement, and when he smiled, it was like watching the sun come up.

My brain scrambled to form words. Something witty. Something charming. Something that would prove I was worth talking to instead of a complete disaster of a human being.

"Yes," I managed to croak out.

He tilted his head slightly, that perfect smile wavering just a bit. "Sorry, I didn't quite catch that."

Of course he didn't. Because apparently my voice had decided to abandon me completely. I felt heat creep up my neck as I realized how pathetic I must look—wide-eyed and mute like some kind of startled animal.

I nodded instead, hoping he'd somehow understand what I was trying to communicate.

He laughed, but it wasn't mean. It was confused and a little awkward, like he was trying to figure out if I was messing with him. "Okay, well... would it be alright if I sat here? Everywhere else seems pretty full."

My heart did something that felt suspiciously like a backflip. This was it. This was how romance novels started. He'd sit next to me, we'd bond over calculus, and before I knew it we'd be having deep conversations about life and dreams and—oh god, we'd have children. Beautiful, mathematically gifted children who actually knew how to talk to people. We'd live in a cute apartment with plants that I'd somehow learn to keep alive, and he'd make coffee in the mornings while I—

"Um, is that a yes?"

I snapped back to reality, realizing I'd been staring at him with what was probably the most ridiculous expression imaginable. I nodded frantically and looked back down at my paper, my cheeks burning with embarrassment.

The chair next to me scraped against the floor as he settled in. Why was he sitting here? There had to be other seats available, right? Maybe he felt sorry for me. Maybe this was some kind of social experiment. Maybe he was new and didn't realize that sitting next to Clara Evans was social suicide.

Who was he, anyway? I'd never seen him before, and I would have remembered a face like that. Transfer student, maybe? But who transferred in their senior year? And to Brighton College of all places? He seemed way too put-together for this school.

"I'm Sunny," he said, pulling out a notebook that looked suspiciously organized. "Just transferred here from Seoul University. My father's work brought us to the States."

Seoul University. Of course. That explained the confidence, the perfect posture, the way he seemed to actually understand what Professor Chen was talking about. I should probably introduce myself. That's what normal people did, right?

Instead, I managed a small nod and kept my eyes glued to my paper.

"This is usually the part where you tell me your name," he said, and I could hear the smile in his voice. "Unless you prefer to go by 'the girl in the back corner who sleeps through math class.' Which, honestly, I kind of respect."

Was that... was he making a joke? About me sleeping? Oh god, he'd seen me drooling on my desk. I wanted to disappear into the floor.

"I'm kidding," he added quickly, probably noticing my deer-in-headlights expression. "Though you did look pretty comfortable earlier. I'm actually jealous—I haven't had a good nap in weeks."

He was being nice. Friendly. Trying to make conversation like a normal person would. And here I was, acting like I'd forgotten how human interaction worked.

"Clara," I whispered, so quietly I wasn't even sure I'd actually said it out loud.

"Clara," he repeated, and something about the way he said my name made my stomach do weird flips. "That's a nice name."

Professor Chen's voice droned on in the background, something about limits and continuity that I should probably be paying attention to. But Sunny was right there, occasionally scribbling notes in handwriting that looked like it belonged in a calligraphy textbook, and every few minutes he'd glance over like he was checking to see if I was still breathing.

I should say something. Ask him about Seoul, or what it was like adjusting to American universities, or literally anything that would prove I was capable of basic human communication. But every time I opened my mouth, my throat seemed to close up.

"So what's your major?" he asked during a lull in Chen's lecture.

Engineering, I thought. Barely passing engineering because I spend more time gaming than studying and I'm probably going to fail this class and disappoint my parents and—

I held up one finger and made a vague gesture that could have meant anything.

He waited for me to elaborate. When I didn't, he tried again.

"Let me guess... art? You have that creative, mysterious vibe."

I shook my head.

"Psychology?"

Another head shake.

"Engineering?"

I nodded, probably too enthusiastically.

"Cool! What kind? I'm doing computer science myself, with a focus on AI development."

Of course he was. Of course he was brilliant and accomplished and probably had internships lined up at Google while I was struggling to understand basic calculus.

The minutes crawled by in a painful cycle of him making friendly conversation and me responding with nods, head shakes, or single syllables that barely qualified as words. He tried asking about my favorite programming languages, whether I'd ever been to any tech meetups, if I had any projects I was working on. Each question was met with my increasingly mortified silence.

By the time Professor Chen started wrapping up the lecture, I was pretty sure I'd set some kind of record for most awkward interaction in human history.

"Well," Sunny said, packing up his perfectly organized notes, "it was nice meeting you, Clara. Maybe I'll see you around?"

I nodded one final time, not trusting myself to speak.

The moment Chen dismissed us, I shoved my blank notebook into my backpack and bolted for the door. I didn't look back, didn't slow down until I'd pushed through the bathroom door and locked myself in a stall.

I sat down on the closed toilet seat and put my head in my hands.

What was wrong with me? He'd been nothing but nice, friendly, trying to make conversation like any normal person would. And I'd just... sat there. Like a broken robot that could only nod and shake its head.

Sophie made it look so easy. She could talk to anyone about anything, crack jokes, be charming and interesting. Meanwhile, I couldn't even manage to tell a gorgeous guy my major without having a minor panic attack.

I was hopeless.
